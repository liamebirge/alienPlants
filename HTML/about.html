					<big>S</big>unlight is hard to come-by most of the time here, so the garden is lit by 4 60w LEDs with color temperatures ranging from 2000k to 2700k and one 15w 18in fluorescent tube light. All lights are turned off and on after 6 hour intervals to reduce the risk of sunburning or stunting the plants and allowing them to open their pours.<br />
					<big>U</big>nder the sun in these plant's natural habitats, temperatures can range from below freezing to higher than 40&deg;C. Since this garden is located and maintained in our living area, we need to keep the temperatures at a comfortable level for human and plant cohabitation. During the day (8am-10pm) the temperature around the plants stays between 20-30&deg;C, and during the night (10pm-8am) the temperature never drops below 10&deg;C. This prevents cold/frost damage to the plants during the night and keeps them at a comfortable warm during the day.<br />
					<big>T</big>his collection of succulents, cacti, ground covers, and anything generally alien looking is currated by Liam English-Birge and Teya Sharir. The garden currently contains around 15 different species of succulents and cacti, and over 50 seperate plants.<br />
					<big>C</big>acti and Succulents are planted in draining plastic planters to prevent overwatering and mold. We use Cactus and Succulent soil that contains healthy/recomended amounts of Phosphoric Acid and Nitrogen. <br />
					<big>A</big>ll of the photos on this site were taken by Liam and Teya with Cannon EOS Rebels T3 and T5 using a Cannon EFS 18-55mm AF lens and a Tamron AF 18-200mm F/3.5-6.3 Macro lens, in conjunction with 7-49mm macro extension tubes for close-ups.<br />
					<big>C</big>actus fertilizer/plant food is used when watering. All plants are watered using 1 of 2 450ml spray bottles until soil is optimally moistened. We add 2-3 drops of 2-7-7 (2% Nitrogen, 7% Available Phosphoric Acid, 7% Soluble Potash) plant food each time the "food bottle" spray bottle is refilled. The other spray bottle is filled with purified water.
