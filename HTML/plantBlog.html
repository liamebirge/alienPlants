							<h3>2/10/18 January-February Update:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							After 4+ weeks since first seeds were planted, none have germinated in either the individual planters or the planter covered in clingwrap. More of the same seeds were planted on the 7th. Cuttings from plant 14 failed to root without green base plant. 10 leaves were taken from our Sedum plant, left to callous and then placed on moist dirt. 9 of the previous Sedum propagations have been successful and have started growing upwards, and 4 have rooted but not yet started growing. 4 leaves were taken from plant 10, 3 of which have rooted and developed stems and leaves while the fourth was placed in moist soil on the 8th and hasn't yet rooted. Fruit Flies have started becoming a problem, we are considering either adding a few Venus Fly-Traps to the garden, or purchasing a pesticide.

							<h3>1/7/18 Planting More New Seeds:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							Since the last update there have been 5 new species planted, Agave (unknown species), Goats Horn Cactus, Cactus Apple, Golden Barrel Cactus, and Santa Rita Cactus. All have been placed into planters with moist soil and covered with cling wrap to trap moisture and increase humidity. Seeds in individual planters are kept inside a pan with the lid on, sitting on a beverage warmer creating a warmer much more humid environment. Cuttings were taken from plant 14 and leaves from plant 13 were placed in soil after 3 days of drying.

							<h3>1/5/18 Planting New Seeds:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							Planted two new cacti species; 2 Night Blooming Cereus (Dragon Fruit) seeds, and 2 San Pedro Cactus seeds. These seeds are germinating in seperate small planters with plenty of water and a bright light to provide heat. 1 Plant 5 sproutling has developed roots big enough to be given own small planter.

							<h3>1/4/18 Returning From Holiday:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							All plants left alone over the break were watered with fertilizer bottle after being in a drought for 2 weeks. Plant 5 has started to grow new sproutlets, the largest of which are about 1.5cm long. We recieved a glass planter as a gift containing 6 new plants, 4 unknown and 2 whcih have been added to the new plants section for the next week or so until they are then put into the gallery. The planter is layered from the bottom with a layer of pebbles, a layer of larger glass pebbles, then a thick layer of generic cactus/succulent soil. We also recieved numerous succulent and cactus seeds which we will be planting throughout the year. The seeds that have been recently planted will remain in the new plants section until they start to sprout (Images used on seeds are what they should look like grown).

							<h3>12/14/17 Holiday Preperations:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							As both Teya and Liam will be away from the plants for the holidays, preperations were made to make sure the plants had their basic needs met. The lights used are connected to a timer that simulates an even 6 hour day night cycle with lights turning on at 00:00, off at 06:00, back on at 12:00, then off again at 18:00. The plants were given a deep soaking and the room's climate control was turned off before we left.

							<h3>12/12/17 Plant re-aranging and propagation success:</h3>
						</div>
						<div id="updateSection">
							Planter 1 was moved to the lower level of the desk and is now lit mainly by the 18" flourescent tube. Propagations from Plant 10 have started to grow root headers and have been moved to small planters. This propagation will be added to the new plants section if it roots successfully and starts to grow a plant.

						<div id="updateSection">
							All 16 plants are kept indoors at 20-25&deg;C during the daytime and 15-20&deg;C during the night. All plants have their health and soil inspected every day. Planter 1 contains plants 5, 9, 10, 12, and Young Plant 2, it is lit by 1 350 lumen 40w led lamp. Planter 2 contains plants 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, a Zwartkop trimming, and 2 sproutlings from plant 5 (Young Plant 1), it is lit by a 800 lumen 60w led light and a 18" florescent tube. All other plants are kept in seperate pots and are lit by a different 800 lumen 60w led.
